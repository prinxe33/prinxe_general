Types of Energy: 

Coal: combustable black or brown sedimentary rock, decompossed plants get pressurized to make coal, 
    Coal Forests: pre-historic wetlands that got pressurized over billions of years 

Tiers of Coal: 
    1. Anthracite: Highest Rank, "hard coal"
        High percentage of fixed carbon, low percentage of volatile matter 
        95% Carbon 5% Mineral
    2. Bituminous: 2nd Highets Rank, electricty generation, steel making 
        86-91% Carbon 
    3. Subbituminous: 2nd Lowest Rank, low-medium heating values, electric generation
        80% Carbon 
    4. Lignite: Lowest Rank, lowest concintration of carbon, low heating values, high moisture count, electricty generation 
        65% Carbon 

How do we get Coal??
    Surface Mining vs Underground Mining:
        Surface: Less than 200 feet underground 
            - Large machine remove the "overburdon" which is topsoil and rocks  
            - Makes up 2/3rds of the total coal mining 
        Underground: More than 200 feet underground, 'deep mining' 
            - Can be up to 1000's of feet below ground 

    Processing Coal: 
        - Once taken from the ground the coal is sent to processing plants to remove the ash and dirt to increase heating value of coal 
        - Trains are used in 70% of all coal transportation 
        - Transportation can be more expensive then mining, coal-fired electric plants are near fields to minimize transportation cost 
 
    Coal Mining Locations: 
        China - 4237 mT make up over half of the worlds demand for coal 
        India
        Indonesia 
        USA
        AUSTRALIA
        Russia
        Rest of the World: 
        
        China- Indonesia - India make up 70% of all coal demand 

Enviormental Groups: 

    OCED: Group of contires (UK, Europe, USA, AUSTRALIA, JAPAN) that have plan to stimulate international trade and economic fluitity 
        OECD Bi-Annual Report: Covers inflation, debt of contries, GPD Changes, international trade 
        OECD Factbook: Annual report of social, economic, and enviormental changes (Iphone App, pdf, online)
        Main Economic Indicators: Published monthly, timely economic indicators 

    Powering Past Coast Allience: Group of nations that focus on phasing out coal and obtaining clean energy 
        Members: most of EU, Central America contires, not US or ASIA 

    C40 Cities: Group of cities from all major contires 
        Affiliates: Clinton Foundation, World Bank
        Does not publish anything that can be found, either a money washing or WEF front 

    International Energy Agency: only OCED memebers can join 
        - Association contries include China, Ukriane, India, Brazil, Argentina 
        - Comes together to provide data, critisim that downplay oil risks
        - Agreement to supply the world with oil, solar and wind energy to replace coal over time
